### SVAR Analysis of Monetary Policy in the COVID-19 Era

The project studies the effectiveness of monetary policy before, during, and after COVID-19 in the euro area and the United States using Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) models with sign restrictions, grounded in a New Keynesian framework.

## Research Goals

- Evaluate how monetary policy transmission changed across periods:
  - Pre-COVID
  - COVID crisis
  - Post-COVID
- Compare responses between the euro area and the United States
- Identify and interpret structural monetary policy shocks
- Measure effects on:
  - Overnight interest rates
  - Inflation
  - Output gap

## Methodology

- Reduced-form Bayesian VAR estimation
- Independent normal–Wishart priors
- Structural identification via sign restrictions
- Impulse Response Functions (IRFs)
- Historical Decompositions (HDs)
- Time-series preprocessing and stationarity analysis
