I am Roc, a graduate in **Economics** and **Statistics** (University of Barcelona & UPC).  
My research interest lies at the intersection of economics, finance and data science: I apply econometric, statistical and machine learning methods to identify and model the dynamics that structure economic systems and financial variables.

# Research focus

- Quantitative economics and quantitative finance  
- Econometric methods, time-series analysis, causal inference  
- Machine learning & deep learning applied to economic/financial data  
- Current interests: monetary policy effects, financial markets dynamics, risk modelling

# Projects & Work-in-Progress

I will be publishing personal projects and reproducible code while preparing applications for an MSc in Economics / Quantitative Finance. Expect:
- Reproducible notebooks and scripts (Python, R, Matlab)
- Deep learning code for both finance-related and broader applications
- Short project write-ups and reproducible results

See the [Projects](https://roc-sastre.github.io/publications) page for ongoing work.

# Writing & Blog

Occasionally I publish less data-driven essays discussing economic and financial issues from a logical and analytical perspective. These pieces are intended to complement the more technical work with policy-oriented and conceptual discussion.

Read posts on the [Blog](https://roc-sastre.github.io/posts).

# Experience

- Professional experience in **banking** and **insurance** — applied quantitative work and practical exposure to financial systems.  
- Strong foundation in statistics, programming and applied economics.

# Publications & Reports

I have not yet published peer-reviewed academic articles. My undergraduate capstone (double degree final project) analyzed the effects of monetary policy during the COVID-19 era — available [here](https://roc-sastre.github.io/files/TFG-ECOEST_Sastre_2025.pdf).

Planned: academic submissions following completion of an MSc.

# Code & Reproducibility

I publish code and scripts (deep learning + econometrics) in a public repository. Expect:
- Jupyter notebooks with reproducible analyses
- Python packages / helper scripts for data preprocessing and model evaluation
- Clear READMEs and usage examples
